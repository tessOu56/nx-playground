## Technology Highlights (How It's Built)

### Modern Web Platform
**React 19 + TypeScript**
- Industry-standard technologies used by companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix
- Type safety ensures reliability (catches errors before deployment)
- Latest features for optimal performance

**Progressive Web App (PWA)**
- Can be installed like a native mobile app
- Works offline after first visit
- Fast loading through intelligent caching

### Performance Excellence

**Lighthouse Score: 90+** (Industry Benchmark)
- Performance: 90+ (loads in < 2 seconds)
- Accessibility: 95+ (usable by people with disabilities)
- Best Practices: 100 (follows web standards)
- SEO: 100 (optimized for search engines)

**What this means**:
- Fast, smooth user experience

- Accessible to all users
- Discoverable on search engines

### Smart Architecture

**Nx Monorepo Structure**
- **Benefit**: Code reusability across projects (write once, use everywhere)
- **Result**: Faster development, consistent quality
- **Scale**: 10 shared libraries, 7 applications using them

**Code Splitting**
- **Benefit**: Only loads what's needed for current page
- **Result**: Faster initial load, better perceived performance
- **Impact**: ~250KB initial bundle (highly optimized)

---

## Project Scope & Scale
