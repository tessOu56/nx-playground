# Event Management Console – 活動管理後台

(Event Content Management System)

## Overview / 概念與定位

This is a comprehensive **admin console** for creating, editing, and managing events with rich content editing capabilities.

Unlike simple event forms, this system provides:
- Multi-step form wizard with validation
- Drag-and-drop form builder for custom fields
- Role-based access control for team collaboration
- Draft and publish workflow for content approval
- Real-time preview of event pages

The design serves as a **complete backend management solution** for event platforms, demonstrating enterprise-grade admin interface design.
