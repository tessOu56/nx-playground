# Enterprise Admin – 企業管理平台

(Enterprise Administration Console)

## Overview / 概念與定位

This is an **enterprise-grade admin console** demonstrating Angular 20 expertise with advanced features like dual-control approval workflows and role-based access control.

Unlike standard admin panels, this system offers:
- Dual-control approval (maker-checker pattern) for critical operations
- Granular role-based permissions (RBAC)
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
- Modern Angular 20 with Signals and standalone components

The design showcases **enterprise application architecture**, demonstrating complex workflow management and security controls.

## Core Features / 核心功能

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Granular permission system at feature and action level
- Role templates (Admin, Manager, Operator, Viewer)
- Dynamic permission assignment
- Permission inheritance and overrides
- Real-time permission updates

**Key Value**: Fine-grained access control ensuring users only see and do what they're authorized for.

---

### 2. Dual-Control Approval Workflow

- Maker-Checker pattern for sensitive operations
- Multi-stage approval chains
- Approval delegation and escalation
- Time-bound approval requests
- Rejection with comments and resubmission

**Key Value**: Prevents unauthorized changes through segregation of duties, critical for financial and regulated industries.

---

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring

- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates
- User activity dashboard
- System health monitoring
- Alert notifications
- Automatic reconnection handling

**Key Value**: Instant visibility into system activity without manual refresh, enabling quick response to issues.

---

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Trail

- All actions logged with timestamp and actor
- Before/after state comparison
- Filterable audit logs by user, action, date
- Export audit data for compliance
- Immutable log storage

**Key Value**: Full traceability for security investigations and regulatory compliance.
