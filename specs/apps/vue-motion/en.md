# Vue Motion Sandbox – Vue 動畫沙盒

(Animation and Motion Design Showcase)

## Overview / 概念與定位

This is an **animation playground** built with Vue 3, showcasing advanced motion design and creative UI development.

Unlike static demo sites, this sandbox offers:
- Interactive animation experiments with real-time controls
- Multiple animation libraries (GSAP, Three.js, Lottie) in one place
- Exportable animation presets for reuse
- Performance-optimized complex animations
- Vue 3 Composition API demonstration

The design serves as a **creative showcase** demonstrating Vue framework expertise and cross-framework versatility in the monorepo.
