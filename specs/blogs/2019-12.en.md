# Starting the Tech Journey - 2019 Review

## ðŸŒ± Career Transition and Foundation Training

Before entering the industry, I came from a **non-CS background** but completed a comprehensive web development training program.

In a short period, I transitioned from zero coding experience to independent development capability, learning and practicing:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** fundamentals
- Interactive component development with **jQuery and Vue 2**
- Backend programming with **PHP** and **MySQL** database management

This intensive training built a solid foundation and taught me how to **quickly learn new languages and frameworks**.

---

## First Steps in the Industry: Information Security Company

After training, I joined an **information security company** with government certification, primarily responsible for developing internal management and monitoring systems.

My first real project was leading the development of the **company's internal project management system** from scratch.

### Project Scope

This system would serve all IT staff across the company for:
- Project progress tracking
- Task assignment and management
- Version planning and releases

Since it would be used company-wide, I needed to:
- Continuously communicate with management and user departments
- Integrate feedback and rapidly execute iterations
- Proactively create requirement documentation and feature planning
- Establish development priorities and release cadence

---

## Technical Stack Transition

To align with the company's existing architecture, I **transitioned from PHP + Vue 2 to C# + React**.

Through re-learning and hands-on practice, I quickly familiarized myself with:
- **.NET Framework** development logic
- Frontend-backend integration patterns
- Building scalable, modular interfaces with **React**
- Implementing data flow and permission controls with **SQL Server**

**This was my first complete commercial product development**, where I was responsible for:
- Requirements analysis
- System design
- Continuous optimization

### Project Highlights

- âœ… Planned and developed company project management system from zero (React + C# + SQL Server)
- âœ… Full ownership of system architecture, data design, and version planning
- âœ… Continuous communication with management and users for requirements integration
- âœ… Built task tracking, permission control, and reporting modules
- âœ… Ensured system stability and data security under strict security requirements

---

## Product and Process Integration Mindset

I was also responsible for the system's **UI/UX design** and **ERP module architecture**.

I fully planned:
- User operation flows
- Data transmission logic
- From requirements discussion to feature definition

**Key Learning**: I learned to think from user and business perspectives, not just engineering execution. I understood how enterprise workflows can be transformed into maintainable logical architectures through systematization.

---

## Technical Adaptation and Growth

The biggest challenge this year was **technical transition**.

I switched from familiar PHP + Vue 2 to the company's C# + React + SQL Server environment.

Through continuous practice and self-learning, I quickly adapted to:
- Language differences
- Framework paradigms
- Not only completing tasks but also cultivating **cross-technology learning ability** and execution flexibility

### Main Achievements

- âœ… Built a company-wide project management system from zero
- âœ… Successfully transitioned from PHP/Vue to C#/React tech stack
- âœ… Mastered frontend-backend data flow, system design, and workflow integration
- âœ… Established user-needs-driven product development mindset

---

## Key Milestones in 2019

**Career Transition**:
- Completed web development training and entered information security industry

**System Development**:
- Planned and led company internal project management system from zero
- Successfully executed cross-tech-stack transition (PHP/Vue â†’ C#/React)

**Product Thinking**:
- Led UI/UX design and ERP module architecture
- Established version planning, requirements integration, and feedback processes

---

## Reflection

2019 was the pivotal year I transitioned from **"learning" to "real-world execution"**.

I not only rapidly completed the technical transition from training to practice, but also planned and implemented a system supporting the entire company's operations within a rigorous information security environment.

This year taught me that the **core value of software development** lies in:
- Understanding requirements
- Organizing logic
- Executing implementation

It laid a solid foundation for my product-oriented and system-thinking approach in the years to come.

_The journey continues as technology becomes the tool, and product thinking becomes the foundation._
