# Starting the Tech Journey - 2019 Review

## From Non-CS Background to Web Development

Before entering the industry, I came from a non-CS background but completed a professional training program in web development.

During this period, I learned **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, practiced **jQuery and Vue 2**, and gradually built a solid foundation in interactive UI development.

I also explored backend programming with **PHP** and managed databases using **SQL and SQL Server**, which helped me understand how data is exchanged and stored between frontend and backend systems.

## Beyond Coding: Design Thinking

Beyond coding, I was involved in **UI/UX planning** and **ERP system design**, gaining an understanding of how business logic and workflow shape software requirements.

This exposure allowed me to connect technical implementation with product and user perspectives.

---

## Entering the Industry

After entering the industry, I adopted **React** as my primary development framework and built backend APIs with **C# and the .NET Framework** to meet project demands.

Since then, I have continuously worked under **Agile/SCRUM methodologies**—treating programming as a tool and product design as the core of my professional direction.

My work has consistently bridged both the technical and conceptual sides of product creation, from user interface planning to system architecture discussions.

This foundation has shaped my career direction: **Product-driven, technology-enabled**.
