# Technical Deepening and UX Enhancement in 2021

## ðŸ§© Continuous Development and Technical Refinement

In 2021, I continued maintaining and expanding the systems developed over the previous two years, including the **project management platform, internal API management tool, and cross-department monitoring system**.

The core tech stack remained **React, C# (.NET Framework), and SQL Server**, focusing on frontend architecture **stability, performance, and long-term maintainability**.

This year was not about switching tech stacks but about **making existing architecture more refined and closer to actual use cases**.

---

## Frontend Focus: Data Visualization and Performance Optimization

Frontend development focused on **data presentation and user experience improvements**.

I built **reusable chart components** and data visualization modules, utilizing **React + WebSocket** to handle real-time data updates, ensuring the interface remained stable and smooth even in high-data-volume scenarios.

I also conducted multiple optimizations on data rendering and loading processes, maintaining good operational experience in reporting and monitoring interfaces.

### Main Work Items

- âœ… Designed and developed multiple chart component types (line charts, pie charts, real-time monitoring charts)
- âœ… Improved frontend data flow and rendering performance
- âœ… Optimized user interface and interaction flows
- âœ… Built maintainable data visualization infrastructure

---

## Backend Integration and System Optimization

To support frontend performance and data update requirements, I continued **API maintenance and SQL performance tuning**, ensuring data transmission accuracy and response speed.

Although not a primary backend developer, I could **independently debug and modify backend APIs**, ensuring stable operation for frontend real-time monitoring and reporting scenarios.

---

## Practical Deployment and Operations

During deployment phases, I was responsible for **packaging projects and deploying to VM (virtual machine)-managed server environments** following company technical department procedures.

I handled:
- Testing and validation
- Version reporting
- Ensuring stable releases

This process deepened my familiarity with **frontend deployment and operational boundary collaboration**.

---

## Team Collaboration and Quality Maintenance

As the department continued to grow, I helped establish:
- **Code review** processes
- Technical documentation
- **Git branching strategies**
- Daily stand-up coordination for project progress and quality standards

I began focusing on **team collaboration rhythm and maintainability**, making frontend engineering not just development tasks but a **sustainable architecture system**.

---

## Key Milestones in 2021

**System Maintenance**:
- Maintained and expanded existing systems (project management, API tool, monitoring platform)

**Frontend Excellence**:
- Focused on data visualization, performance, and UX optimization
- Strengthened frontend-backend data integration and API stability

**Operations**:
- Packaged and deployed to VM environments ensuring stable releases
- Established code review processes and collaboration standards

---

## Career Transition and Reflection

2021 was a year of **consolidating core frontend capabilities**.

I focused on making systems **faster, more stable, and more user-friendly**, while establishing a long-term perspective on team collaboration and architecture maintenance.

### Year-End Decision

At the end of the year, based on **career planning and learning goals**, I chose to leave this company.

After summarizing my three-year experience from 2019 to 2021, I fully reviewed my technical growth trajectory from:
- Foundation development
- Architecture thinking
- Product-oriented approach

**Key Realization**: Frontend engineering is not just interface implementation but the **core link connecting user experience, system logic, and product value**.

I organized my technical insights from these three years and moved forward with a clearer direction and professional positioning into the next chapterâ€”**the journey of 2022**.
