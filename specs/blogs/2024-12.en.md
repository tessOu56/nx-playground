# Multi-Domain Practice and System Integration Deepening in 2024

## üåê First Half: Freelance and On-Site Project Experience

In the first half of 2024, I continued participating in follow-up module development for my previous company's project.

After project changes, based on career planning, I chose to leave and transitioned to **freelance and short-term on-site work** as my primary mode, taking on multiple practical projects centered on **React technology**.

### Tech Stack

React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, WebSocket, SSE, Lottie.js

### Projects Undertaken

#### 1. Professional Corporate Website Development

Built modular content system and RWD responsive layouts using **React + Vite**.

**Key Features**:
- Combined **Lottie.js** for dynamic transition animations and interactive effects
- Performance optimization for initial load and animation rendering (**Lazy Loading + Intersection Observer**)
- Deployment integration following client strategy
- Responsible for packaging and environment setup, ensuring seamless deployment to client servers

#### 2. Hardware Integration Interface Development

Collaborated with backend and hardware engineers, using:
- **WebSocket (WS)** for bidirectional real-time communication
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for device status pushing

**Implementation**:
- Real-time display of machine operation data in browser
- Anomaly alerts and feedback control
- Designed **error retry and data replay buffer mechanism**
- System can automatically resume data synchronization after connection interruption

**Ownership**: I independently managed product planning, architecture design, and progress scheduling for these projects, maintaining development rhythm and technical consistency while collaborating with designers and backend engineers.

## Technical Breakthrough: IoT Data Flow Integration

The most important technical breakthrough in the first half was **frontend and IoT data flow integration**.

I designed a **multi-layer data flow architecture** for high-frequency real-time data transmission and display:

### Dual-Channel Real-Time Architecture

- **WS** for control responses
- **SSE** for continuous monitoring data

### Data Buffering and Layered Updates

- **Zustand** cache layer
- Batch updates to reduce re-renders

### Fault Tolerance and Reconnection

- **Exponential Backoff** automatic reconnection
- UI layer provides user status indication

### Visualized Data Throttling

- High-frequency sensor values displayed at sampling rate
- Balances performance and real-time requirements

**These experiences** familiarized me with frontend design patterns for handling real-time data flow, flow control, and visualization in IoT systems, while strengthening cross-layer data consistency and browser performance optimization capabilities.

## Second Half: Joining a Digital Product Company

In the second half of 2024, I joined a **digital product company** as **Frontend Engineer and System Analyst (SA)**.

The company's main product was a multi-module digital platform. When I joined, the project had already been under development for one year.

### Core Responsibilities

- ‚úÖ Transform product team requirement documents into **concrete technical specifications**
- ‚úÖ Coordinate frontend-backend **API and data structure definitions**
- ‚úÖ Participate in frontend module development and **Design System** construction
- ‚úÖ Assist outsourcing and internal team communication on technical details and development priorities

---

## Technical and System Practice

The project architecture used **RESTful API** with backend developed in **Go**.

### My Work

I was responsible for:
- Frontend and API integration design
- Error response and data consistency management
- Writing business modules with **React + TypeScript**
- Implementing state management and caching strategies
- Ensuring smooth data transmission between multiple modules

---

## SSO (Single Sign-On) System Development

Addressing the company's multi-product-line user identity integration needs, I collaborated with the backend lead to develop an **SSO (Single Sign-On) system**.

### Implementation

**Core Mechanism**: Cookies-based authentication

**Integration**:
- Login, logout, and permission verification flows
- Designed reusable frontend **Auth Context** module

**Success**:
- ‚úÖ Different domain products maintain consistent login state
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience
- ‚úÖ Simplified operations procedures

---

## Design System Construction

I collaborated with the UI/UX team to build the company's internal **Design System**.

### My Responsibilities

- Abstract design components into reusable **React Component Library**
- Combined **Storybook, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript Props Validation**
- Ensured consistent interaction behaviors, styling, and documented displays

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Different product lines share unified design language
- ‚úÖ Significantly improved frontend development efficiency and consistency

---

## Team Collaboration and Process Contribution

I was responsible for **transforming product team requirements into executable technical specifications**.

### Spec Tracker System

Built **"Spec Tracker"** using Notion to centrally manage:
- Design mockups
- API mappings
- Frontend state
- Version progress

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Outsourcing teams and internal engineers track requirement implementation with unified structure
- ‚úÖ Real-time version change retrospection
- ‚úÖ Product decisions and development processes more transparent and continuously iterable

## Year-End Review

2024 was my turning point in **"cross-domain integration √ó frontend architecture deepening"**.

### First Half
- Accumulated **IoT real-time data integration** and **animation interaction development** experience through freelance projects

### Second Half
- Practiced **requirement translation**, **identity authentication system design**, and **Design System construction** in enterprise environment

**Career Direction Confirmed**:
- Continue with **React ecosystem as the core**
- Combine **system architecture thinking with product collaboration experience**
- Continuously deepen **technical depth and cross-domain integration capabilities** in the frontend field
