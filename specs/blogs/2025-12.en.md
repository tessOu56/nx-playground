# Architecture Refactoring and Development Culture Advancement in 2025

## ðŸ§© Project Background and Refactoring Opportunity

In 2025, I continued working at the digital product company, responsible for **frontend development and system architecture** of the main digital platform.

As the company expanded business under annual operational goals, the product line rapidly added multiple new modules and features. The existing system gradually showed burden in **performance, maintenance, and development processes**.

To address this expansion wave, I **led the overall refactoring** of the frontend project and introduced **Nx Monorepo architecture** to support long-term multi-module development.

---

## Main Refactoring Goals and Achievements

### Nx Monorepo Introduction

- Managed multiple applications and shared modules with **Nx**
- Established cross-project shareable logic and style libraries

### Data Flow Optimization

- Combined **React Context + Zustand** for hierarchical state management
- Clearly separated Session, cache, and business logic
- Improved maintainability and performance

### Performance Enhancement

- Redesigned **Lazy Loading, SSR data prefetching, and Code Splitting** mechanisms
- Reduced loading time and improved interaction fluidity

### Design System Maintenance

- Continued collaboration with design team
- Maintained component system based on **Storybook + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript**
- Ensured all modules maintain consistent design language and documentation standards

---

## Second Half: Frontend-Backend Separation Architecture

Due to product direction adjustments in the second half, the platform added:
- **Frontend-backend separation architecture**
- **Internal management system**

### My Responsibilities

- Shared module planning
- User role and permission design
- Frontend and backend sharing core logic while maintaining independent development and deployment flexibility

---

## Technical Deepening and System Integration

2025's technical focus was on **consolidating frontend-backend integration processes** and establishing **long-term operational architecture**.

I built a stable technical system based on **Next.js (App Router)**, combined with:
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Zustand
- RESTful API
- Go backend collaboration

### Type and Consistency Control

- **TypeScript strict mode** unified interface definitions
- Formulated shared **Response Interface** for frontend-backend APIs
- Reduced data errors

### Code Quality and Operations Workflow

**CI Process Integration**:
- ESLint / Prettier / Type Check / Build Cache automated checks
- Designed automated testing and version tagging scripts
- Ensured every merge passes validation

**Deployment and Containerization**:
- Wrote **Dockerfile** and multi-stage build scripts
- Used **docker-compose** for integration testing
- Participated in **GitHub Actions** workflow design
- Responsible for automated builds, version tagging, and environment deployment (Staging / Production)

**Through these practices**, I mastered the complete technical chain from development, testing, to deployment, ensuring project stability and traceability under multi-person collaboration and high-frequency deployment.

---

## Development Process and Team Culture Introduction

As product modules and personnel increased, I **promoted the team to establish Scrum development culture** and **systematized software development processes**.

### Main Initiatives

**Scrum Process**:
- Collaborated with PM to plan Sprint process
- Regularly held Planning / Review / Retrospective

**Task Management**:
- Used **Notion + GitHub Projects** to manage development tasks and requirement documents

**Onboarding**:
- Guided new cross-department members (marketing, PM, design, frontend interns)
- Explained Agile development rhythm and task decomposition

**Developer Handbook**:
- Formulated unified branching strategy
- Commit standards
- Version naming conventions

**Mentorship**:
- Led new engineers in **Code Review and Pair Programming**
- Strengthened code quality and team rapport

**These systems** enabled the team to form a common development language and rhythm, improving cross-department communication efficiency and allowing product development to advance at a stable pace.

---

## Product and Operations Layer Participation

I simultaneously participated in product system layer design and operations:

### Role and Permission System (RBAC)

- Defined frontend-backend user levels
- Data access control design

### API Specification and Error Handling

- Collaborated with Go backend
- Established unified **Response Template** and status code standards

### Design System Long-term Maintenance

- Introduced version management and Changelog mechanisms
- Maintained cross-module compatibility

### CI/CD Automation Process

- Designed automatic **Health Check** and **Smoke Test** mechanisms
- Monitored deployment quality

**These implementations** allowed me to view frontend engineering from an **architecture perspective**, ensuring the product maintains stability and extensibility during functional expansion.

---

## Year-End Review

2025 was an important stage in **architecture governance and development culture advancement**.

### Key Achievements

**Architecture**:
- Led frontend project refactoring and Nx introduction
- Improved modular development, version control, and Design System maintenance

**Culture**:
- Introduced Scrum process
- Established team development rhythm and communication standards

**DevOps**:
- Participated in Dockerization and CI/CD automated deployment design
- Formed complete automated process from development to deployment

### Focus Areas in 2025

- Frontend architecture governance and Nx modular management
- Agile development process introduction and team culture establishment
- CI/CD automation and deployment optimization
- Design System long-term maintenance and cross-product integration

---

## Career Transition

After completing annual refactoring and module expansion, due to **company business direction and product strategy adjustments at year-end**, the team structure changed synchronously.

I formally left after completing established projects and deployment goals.

**This experience** deepened my understanding of:
- **"Software engineering governance"**
- **"Long-term architecture maintenance"**

And confirmed my future development direction:
- Continue with **React / Next.js ecosystem, Nx architecture, DevOps integration, and frontend system design** as the core
- Continuously advance the **balance between stability and innovation** between product and technology

---

_Moving forward with architecture governance expertise, team leadership experience, and comprehensive DevOps integration skills._
