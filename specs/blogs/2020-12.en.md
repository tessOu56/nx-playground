# My React Journey in 2020

## React Deepening and System-Oriented Development

In 2020, I continued developing the company's internal project management system, fully adopting **React Hooks and Context** to modernize and modularize the front-end architecture.

At the same time, I began taking on larger, cross-department projects that required both technical execution and system-level thinking.

---

## First Half: Official Website Development

During the first half of the year, I collaborated with the company's designer to build the **official website in both English and Chinese**.

I handled the content structure, responsive layout, and front-end implementation. The project took about **three months from planning to launch** and taught me how multilingual websites intersect with SEO and content management.

**Key Learnings**:

- Information architecture for bilingual sites
- Responsive design across devices
- SEO optimization and content structure
- Complete product cycle from planning to launch

---

## Second Half: Real-Time Monitoring Platform

Later that year, my supervisor assigned me to a new **data monitoring platform** as part of the company's regulated, security-critical datacenter operations.

The project involved implementing:

- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time data streaming
- Integration with the **Elastic Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)**

### My Responsibilities

**Frontend Integration**:

- ElasticSearch API integration
- Real-time data visualization
- Performance optimization for high-volume data

**ELK Stack Collaboration**:

- Assisted with Logstash pipeline configurations
- Tested data visualization through Kibana dashboards
- Learned to balance performance, bandwidth, and security

**Key Achievement**: First experience designing React applications that handle **high-volume, real-time data** while maintaining performance and security.

## Team Growth and Backend Support

As the department expanded, new team members joined, and I began supporting both **frontend and backend** efforts.

**Backend Development**:

- Developed asset management system APIs in **C#/.NET Framework**
- REST API design and implementation
- Database integration

**Collaboration & Process**:

- Contributed to sprint planning and daily stand-ups
- Learned to balance development progress with communication
- Coordinated cross-department needs

---

## System Evolution

These experiences shaped the next evolution of our **internal project management system**, turning it into a:

- Multi-department integration platform
- Centralized workflow management tool
- Foundation for cross-functional collaboration

---

## Key Milestones in 2020

**Technical Growth**:

- Deepened React Hooks and Context usage for scalable architecture
- Built a bilingual (EN/CH) official website with responsive design and SEO
- Developed a secure real-time monitoring platform integrating the ELK Stack
- Supported backend modules in C# for asset management systems

**System Thinking**:

- Expanded internal project management into a multi-department platform
- Learned to bridge architecture, process, and collaboration
- Shifted from feature development to system integration

---

## Reflection

2020 was the year I transitioned from a **frontend developer** into a **system integrator**â€”bridging architecture, process, and collaboration within enterprise-scale projects.

This evolution reinforced my career philosophy: **Technology as a tool, product thinking as the foundation**.

---

_As the journey progresses, I continue to deepen both technical expertise and system-level product thinking._
