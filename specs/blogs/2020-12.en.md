# React Deepening and System-Oriented Development in 2020

## ⚙️ Technical Deepening and Team Growth

In 2020, I continued developing the company's internal project management system while collaborating with frontend colleagues to advance our **React expertise**.

Although we didn't have formal study groups, we regularly shared learnings, discussed latest framework trends, and explored development details. This continuous knowledge exchange enabled us to rapidly absorb new concepts and apply them to our projects.

I fully adopted **React Hooks and Context**, reorganizing the frontend architecture to make the system more modular, state management clearer, and maintenance easier. This process was not just a technical refactoring but also a phase of mutual growth and experience accumulation with the team.

As the company's main business involved large-scale data and cross-department integration, I handled **React architecture optimization** and system module development on the frontend, while also supporting backend work (**C# / .NET Framework / SQL Server**) to ensure data consistency and operational stability across modules.

## Official Website Development: Bilingual and Complete Cycle

Beyond internal systems, I collaborated with designers to develop the company's **official website**, handling both **English and Chinese versions** for content structure, responsive layout, and frontend implementation.

The project took about **three months** from content planning and design confirmation to launch. During this period, I coordinated frontend-backend data integration and multilingual content management mechanisms.

**This was my first complete external website project**, experiencing the full product development cycle from requirements discussion and UI design to deployment and operations, while accumulating experience in **SEO and internationalization (i18n)**.

### Project Highlights

- ✅ Bilingual website design and frontend development (i18n / SEO)
- ✅ Responsive layout and content structure optimization
- ✅ Integration of design and frontend development processes
- ✅ Complete product cycle from planning to launch

---

## Self-Initiated Proposal: API Management and Invocation Tool

During the same year, I **proactively proposed and designed an internal API management and invocation tool** to solve department issues with scattered API specifications and difficult version tracking.

This project embraced a **code-first** philosophy, allowing engineers to maintain API specifications with **code as the single source of truth**.

Unlike tools that only generate documentation, this system could directly **convert API definitions into usable frontend and backend code**, enabling real-time invocation and automated testing.

### Project Features

- ✅ Code-first centralized API specification and version management
- ✅ One-click generation of frontend/backend code templates
- ✅ Automated testing and documentation synchronization
- ✅ Cross-project sharing, permission control, and version management

The proposal was evaluated and **adopted by management**, with me leading implementation and deployment.

**Final Impact**: Significantly reduced frontend-backend integration error rates while improving development consistency and communication efficiency. It became an indispensable tool in the department's workflow.

## System Integration and Monitoring Platform

I was also responsible for developing the company's **cross-department security monitoring and data management platform**.

This project required integration of:
- Real-time data streams
- User authentication
- **Elastic Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)**

### My Responsibilities

**Frontend**:
- Data visualization and performance optimization
- High-volume real-time application development
- Balancing performance, bandwidth, and security

**ELK Stack Collaboration**:
- Assisted with Logstash pipeline configuration
- Configured Kibana dashboards for visualization

This experience taught me to handle **high-volume real-time data** in frontend applications.

## Department Collaboration and System Evolution

As the department expanded, I participated in daily stand-ups and development planning, helping integrate task timelines and cross-department requirements.

The project management system underwent multiple version updates throughout the year, evolving from a **single-department tool to a company-wide integration platform**.

---

## Key Milestones in 2020

**Technical Growth**:
- Advanced React skills with team, adopting Hooks/Context architecture
- Developed bilingual official website (i18n / SEO / UX)
- Led internal API management and invocation tool (code-first, auto code-gen, cross-platform)
- Developed cross-department monitoring system integrating ELK Stack
- Maintained and upgraded project management system (cross-department integration)
- Continued backend API development support (C# / SQL Server)

**System Thinking**:
- Proactive tool design and process optimization
- From architecture refactoring to website development to API tooling
- Established "system thinking integrating technology and product" direction
- Built long-term stable technical foundation through continuous team learning

---

## Reflection

2020 was the critical year I evolved from a **"frontend developer"** to a **"system practitioner"**.

I didn't just focus on technical advancement but **actively participated in tool design and process optimization**.

From React architecture refactoring, bilingual website development, to API tool proposals, I gradually established my direction of **"integrating technology and product with system thinking"**.

Through continuous learning and exchange with the team, I built a solid technical foundation for the long term.

_The journey continues as I deepen both technical expertise and system-level product integration._
