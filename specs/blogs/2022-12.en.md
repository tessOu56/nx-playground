# New Architecture and Product-Oriented Transformation in 2022

## ðŸš€ Joining an Internet Media Company

In 2022, I joined an **internet media company** as a **Frontend Engineer** within the IT team.

The department's primary tech stack was **Next.js, PHP Laravel 8, and PostgreSQL**.

This career transition took me from React framework development into the **meta framework (Next.js)** application domain. During brief backend support tasks, I quickly learned **Laravel 8**, further understanding backend framework structures and data integration logic, though frontend development remained my primary focus.

---

## Project Background and Product Refactoring

The company's main project was a **comprehensive refactoring** of an existing product.

### Original System
An internal internet media messaging platform responsible for:
- Company news publishing
- User comment interaction

### Refactoring Goal
Transform the platform into an **external creator platform** where:
- Writers can establish personal brand channels
- Different creators publish articles and share images
- Readers interact within the same ecosystem

I participated with the team in **product requirement analysis, interface design, and feature planning**, adopting **bi-weekly development iterations** with new feature releases every two weeks.

The project required intensive collaboration from design to development, balancing **legacy data compatibility** with **new system extensibility**.

---

## Technical Implementation and Frontend Development

On the frontend, I was responsible for developing and adjusting multiple **key modules**, including:
- Channel homepage
- Article display
- Comment interaction
- Real-time messaging

### Next.js Optimization

Using Next.js **Pages Router** with **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** mechanisms, I:
- Enhanced website loading speed
- Improved SEO effectiveness
- Implemented React-based state management
- Applied component-based design for better performance and maintainability

### Backend Learning

During brief backend support tasks, I engaged with **Laravel 8**, learning:
- Framework routing
- Eloquent ORM
- Data operation workflows

This further deepened my understanding of **frontend-backend collaboration structures**.

### Main Work Items

- âœ… Developed core frontend modules for media platform with Next.js
- âœ… Implemented SSR / SSG mechanisms for improved loading speed and SEO
- âœ… Built interactive comments and real-time update features
- âœ… Participated in product requirement analysis and feature planning
- âœ… Supported backend Laravel API and PostgreSQL integration

---

## Learning and Challenges

Through the development rhythm at this company, I learned **complete product refactoring workflow management**, from:
- Requirement decomposition
- System redesign
- Feature releases

Close collaboration with **designers, backend engineers, and product managers** was essential.

I gradually accumulated experience in **"introducing new technology into existing products"**, not only strengthening programming logic but also learning to **maintain product consistency and quality** within development cycles.

---

## Career Turning Point

Despite rich learnings during this period, due to **company business direction adjustments and organizational changes**, I officially left at year-end.

This experience gave me a deeper understanding of **frontend development's role in product refactoring** and further confirmed my commitment to focusing on frontend engineering centered on **user experience and system logic**.

---

## Year-End Reflection

2022 was a year of **expanded technical perspective**.

I advanced from React architecture to **practical Next.js application**, while learning **Laravel and PostgreSQL** integration workflows.

Through cross-domain development and rapid product iteration, I deepened my understanding of the **relationship between frontend architecture and product logic**.

**Career Direction Confirmed**:
- Continue with **frontend as the core**
- Combine product thinking and system logic
- Use this as my development principle and career extension foundation for all future projects

_Moving forward with a clearer vision: frontend excellence combined with product thinking._
